Sentence Transformers
Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) fine-tuned to produce dense vector representations for sentences or queries.
These embeddings capture semantic similarity effectively.

Workflow:
Vectorization: Converts user queries and content descriptions into fixed-length vectors.
Similarity Search: Compares query and content vectors (e.g., cosine similarity) to identify relevant matches.

Strengths:
Efficiency: Fast similarity computations using vector indexes like FAISS or ANN search.
Customizability: Easy to fine-tune for specific recommendation domains.
Versatility: Works well for ranking and retrieval tasks in recommendation systems.

Use in Recommendation Systems:
Ideal for matching users with similar content or preferences based on semantic similarity.
Often used to power "users who liked this also liked" type of features.

Challenges:
Lack of Contextual Generation: Provides ranked results rather than generating custom outputs.
Dependency on Pre-trained Models: Performance may vary based on the quality of pre-trained embeddings.
